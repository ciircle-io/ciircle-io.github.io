<h1>Questions and Answers</h1>


<h3><a name="vow"></a>Why do you call it a vow?</h3>

<p>It is just a solemn promise. You make it to yourself, so you can make of it what you will.</p>

<p>There are some unfortunate associations with vows, but other words just don't seem to capture
the gravity of this sort of personal promise. I think the imprtant thing is to
remember that it is <b><i>personal</i><b> -- you only make it to yourself.</p>

<h3><a name="religion"></a>Is this a cult? Are you starting a religion?</h3>

<p>No.</p>

<p>There is no membership, no rites or rituals, no dogma, no person of authority.</p>

<h3><a name="falsehoods"></a>You say there are no people of authority, but what are you?</h3>

but I don't claim to be an authority on anything.</p>

<h3><a name="falsehoods"></a>I heard ________ about the Ciircle/Vow/Principles.</h3>
