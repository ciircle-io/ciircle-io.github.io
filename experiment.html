<h1>The Experiment</h1>

<h3><a name="what"></a>What is the experiment?</h3>

<p>The goal of the experiment is to see if a positive message can have the same
viral distribution as a negative message.</p>

<h3><a name="why"></a>Why are your doing this experiment?</h3>

<p>To see if we can mitigate the ignorance, fear, and hatred that spreads with negative viral messages.</p>

<h3><a name="how"></a>How can I get involved in the experiment?</h3>

<p>The easiest way to get involved is to make the vow to yourself. If you forward the invitation,
you are also helping the experiment.</p>

<p>For those wanting to get more involved, there is a mailing list, which I will use for weekly updates.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="https://github.com/ciircle-io/data">GitHub project site</a> where
I will be posting all the data that I collect. You are free to fork and use the
data as you see fit. You also may post issues if you see problems with the data.<p>

<h3><a name="who"></a>Who are you?</h3>

<p>I'm nobody special, really.</p>

<p>My name is Thornton Prime.</p>

<p>I sign the current invitations with an OpenGPG key, which is available from
the GitHub data site.</p>
