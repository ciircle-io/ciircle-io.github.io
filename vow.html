<h1>The Vow and the Principles</h1>


<h2><a name="vow"></a>The Vow</h2>

<h3><a name="vow_what"></a>What exactly is this vow?</h3>

<p>The vow is simply a promise you make to yourself.</p>

<p>You only make it to yourself.  You do not make it to any other person,
organization, or entity.  You can keep it secret or make it public.  It's
entirely up to you.</p>

<p>The vow does not need to replace or supersede any other promise, vow, or
oath you have made.  Again, it is entirely up to you.</p>

<h2><a name="principles"</a>The Principles</h2>

<h3><a name="principles_what"></a>What are the principles?</h3>

<p>The principles are <a href="#humility">humility</a>, <a
href="#compassion">compassion</a>, <a href="#clarity">clarity</a>, and <a
href="#generosity">generosity</a>.</p>

<p>You make the oath to yourself, so you are the final arbiter of what
these principles mean.  There is no official definition of these
principles, but I offer a few personal thoughts below.</p>

<h4><a name="humility"></a>humility</h4>

<p>Humility is simply seeking to be honest with oneself.</p>

<p>Most importantly, this means accepting that I do not know everything,
even about myself.  I am always changing and the world around me is always
changing.  Only if I accept that there is potential for something new in me
and in my view of the world can I embrace who I am.</p>

<p>Humility should not be confused with humiliation.  To submit to
humiliation is to accept another's definition of who we are.  That is not
being honest with oneself, because no external person or group can know the
rich and deep depths of who I am.</p>

<h4><a name="compassion"></a>compassion</h4>

<p>Compassion is being open to understanding the feelings and experiences
of others.</p>

<p>I think it is useful to contrast compassion with empathy.  Compassion
uses the root "com-" which means "with."  Empathy uses the root "em-" which
means "in". Empathy generally implies that we have the experience to
understand someone else's feelings.  Empathy uses personal experience to
analogize the pain and suffering of others.</p>

<p>In contrast, I think of compassion as trying to experience something
with someone, not for them.  I listen to them.  I accept what they are
feeling as something they are feeling, and not as what I think they should
feel or what I might feel in their place.</p>

<p>So if someone tells me they are hurt, my empathetic response might be to
say, "I share your hurt." In contrast, my compassionate response might be,
"I hear that you are hurt. It hurts me that you are hurt. I know I can't take
away your hurt, but I want to understand your hurt, so please tell me how and
why you are hurt."</p> 

<h4><a name="clarity"></a>clarity</h4>

<p>Clarity is removing obstacles to reach a deeper understanding of the truth
of things.</p>

<p>I think it is important to acknowledge that truth is neither absolute nor
is it relative. It is directional. There is no final truth, but there are better
and worse understandings of truth.</p>


<h4><a name="generosity"></a>generosity</h4>

<p>Generosity is offering what we have to others.</p>
